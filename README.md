The simple Android game of guessing the number which has been chosen secretly.\
A user has several attempts to guess the number that has been previously chosen by the system from predefined range on numbers.\
Every time the user fails to guess the number, the game gives him a hint of whether the chosen number is bigger or 
smaller than the provided answer.\
Every successful attempt brings the user credits and resets the number of guessing attempts available.\
